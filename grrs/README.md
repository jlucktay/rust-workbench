# Learning Rust by Writing a Command Line App in 15 Minutes

From [here](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/tutorial/).

## Notes

> Make sure you run Rust 1.31.0 (or later) and that you have edition = "2018" set in the [package] section of your Cargo.toml file.

## The kitchen sink

This will reset to scratch with `clean`, run tests with `test`, build binaries with `build`, and then check for the
existence of the manpage that should have been generated by the build script:

```shell
cargo clean && cargo test && cargo build && [[ "$(ll target/debug/build/**/jlucktay-grrs.1 | wc -l)" -eq 1 ]]
```
