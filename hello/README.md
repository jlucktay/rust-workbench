# hello

From [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-01-single-threaded.html).

## TODO

> We could do more here! If you want to continue enhancing this project, here are some ideas:
>
> - Add more documentation to `ThreadPool` and its public methods.
> - Add tests of the libraryâ€™s functionality.
> - Change calls to `unwrap` to more robust error handling.
> - Use `ThreadPool` to perform some task other than serving web requests.
> - Find a thread pool crate on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) and implement a similar web server using the crate
    instead.
    Then compare its API and robustness to the thread pool we implemented.
